First of all. Add a README. Its what professionals do
You describe your project / what its for

Anyway- the issue was with paths
You need to use paths relative to the file your in

Say you are in `video-production-projects/index.html`
If you want to reference that CNAME file
You would use the path `../CNAME`
../ means go backward
