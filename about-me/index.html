        <p class="leftbody">I am a 14 year old (as of now) and I'm taking Honors Computer Science in High School. I'm making this website because I needed a side project to work on during some of my free time. Anyways, I like to play video games such as Minecraft, which in my opinion, is the all time best video game ever made. Also, I swim for the Bergen Barracudas swim team and I'm on a robotics team known as the Pascack Pi-oneers  (Team 1676).</p>
